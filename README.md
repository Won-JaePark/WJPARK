Paper : Contrast enhancement for 360 degree videos considering the head motion



The experiments were performed on four 360 videos.
The four videos were downloaded from YouTube.
The videos have 30 fps and more than 2k resolution in equirectangular format. We resized the videos to 2160x1080 for experiments in MATLAB.
The YouTube ids and start time offset of the four videos are below:
<video_name : YouTube id, start time offset, experimental duration
